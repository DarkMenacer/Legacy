## Solution in brief
The trick to solve this question is to realise that the sum of player one and two is constant.
i.e.
$\text{one} + \text{two} = \Sigma \text{values}$

Now the objective naturally is to maximise one - two.

With just one value, one - two is that value and with two values, one - two = max_value - min_value.
For three values, the above can be used by breaking into 1+2 and 2+1 values. 

i.e. first choose the leftmost element and consider other two as a unit (difference for which can be found out) then
choose the rightmost element and consider the other two as a unit.

Now, it can be observed that the difference between one and two matters for intervals.

Generalising above approach for calculating the difference of values from interval l to r:

$$diff[l][r] = max(value[l] - diff[l+1][r], value[r]- diff[l][r-1])$$

Consider how to form a top-down approach, to calculate diff[**l**][r] we need diff[**l+1**][r] so l starts from n-1 to 0 
whereas for r, as r can never be smaller than l, it starts as regular but from l to n-1.
