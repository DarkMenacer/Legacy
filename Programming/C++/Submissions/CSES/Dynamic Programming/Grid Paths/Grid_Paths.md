## Solution in brief

There are only 2 ways to visit a square, from top or from the left.
Therefore 
$$\text{no. of ways of visit grid}[x][y] = \text{no. of ways of visit grid}[x-1][y] + \text{no. of ways of visit grid}[x][y-1]$$
Now using memoization and safeguarding boundary cases, the answer for the bottom left square is obtained.
