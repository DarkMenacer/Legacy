****** PRODUCER CONSUMER PROBLEM

Problem statement:-
    We consider two processes, which are called the 'producer' and the 'consumer' respectively. 
    The producer is a cyclic process and each time it goes through its cycle it produces a certain portion of information, 
    that has to be processed by the consumer. The consumer is also a cyclic process and each time it goes through its cycle, 
    it can process the next portion of information, as has been produced by the producer ... 
    We assume the two processes to be connected for this purpose via a buffer with unbounded capacity
