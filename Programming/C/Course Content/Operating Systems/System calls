    1) Process Control
    2) File Management
    3) Device Management
    4) Information Maintenance
    5) Communication

1) Process Control:
    1) fork() : creates child process, returns 0 in child process and pID of child in parent process
    2) exit(status) : terminate process execution, returns status
    3) waitpid(pID, &staloc, options) : wait for a child to terminate, returns ????
    4) execve(name,argv,environp) : ????

2) File Management:
    1) ???

3) Device Management:
