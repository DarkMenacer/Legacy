****** TOO MUCH MILK/TOO LESS MILK

Problem statement:-
    Jack and Jill are newlywed couple. Both of them are avid milk lovers. 
    But they are oddly peculiar about the quantity of milk left at the end of each day.
    They need their daily dose of milk everyday. Hence if milk is not sufficient for both of them,
    they will go individually to the market and buy certain amount of milk.
    But whatever happens, they don't want the quantity of milk to exceed a certain amount because the extra milk is spoiled.
    While they are adjusting to the lifestyle of their spouses, milk is a sensitive issue and mistakes are unforgivable.
    If any of the above two cases happen to occur(too much milk or too less milk), they will divorce each other without second thoughts.
    You are their mutual friend and care about them and want to avoid their split at all costs.
